  <h1>Platformer</h1>

  <p><strong>Platformer</strong> is a reimplementation of the <em>WoodleePlatformGameEngine</em> repository.</p>

  <p>The goal of this project is to establish a cleaner, more maintainable workflow from the outset by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Creating onboarding documentation as the project evolves</li>
    <li>Leveraging GitHub Workflows to enable continuous integration (CI)</li>
    <li>Implementing unit testing from the beginning</li>
    <li>Maintaining modularity and clarity in architecture</li>
  </ul>

  <p>For developers(myself) familiar with <em>WoodleePlatformGameEngine</em>, this repo offers a fresh start with improved structure, documentation, and CI practices.</p>
